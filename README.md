# The Waiting Room
## Description
This application enables the user to select keywords relevant to their allergy concerns that, once submitted, generate an interactive information page customized according to the user's input. To create an intuitive application that dynamically updates, this application utilizes server side APIs and Foundation for CSS styling. 

## User Story:
As someone with aeroallergens, I want to access data relevant to my allergy concerns, so that I can better advocate for myself at my doctor's appointment and take precautions to mitigate symptoms until I can see my doctor.

## Acceptance Criteria:
WHEN I Load the page,

THEN I find a landing page and a disclaimer

WHEN I select the information relevant to me,

THEN I find a wiki article and information about air quality

WHEN I view recent searches

THEN I find past searched articles on the subject

WHEN I reload the page

THEN I see an updated recent searches

WHEN I click on advice to prevent allergies

THEN I am presented with a page that discusses how to help prevent both indoor and outdoor allergies

## MVP:
Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site.
Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
Be responsive.
Have a polished UI.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
